WMB Heavy Haulage is a family run business, with over 30 years experience in the abnormal haulage sector.
 
We currently operate a fleet of 5 Scania tractor units and variety of trailer options capable of transporting abnormal and heavy loads 
up to 80T gross.  Trailers include -

* Power steered, extendable step frames
* Power steered low loader
* Flats, complete with twist locks and stake sockets.

A load escort service is also provided along with all necessary authority notifications.
Our experienced personnel also carry out all necessary site inspections, route surveys and feasibility studies.


The acquisition of a 54T/m, 11m reach crane truck has enhanced the service provided.  An extra vehicle is currently in build, extending 
the lift capacity to 90T/m with a 30m reach.  This vehicle will be complete with a drawbar trailer to further extend the transportation 
options.

Currently goods in transit insurance covers up to &#xA3;500,000.00, all risks, in any one load.  This value may be increased as required.
If load requirements exceed 80T, we have well established links with other hauliers throughout the UK.
 
Risk assessment and method statements are prepared for lifts/transport as appropriate.
