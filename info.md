up to 80T gross.  Trailers include -

* Power steered, extendable step frames
* Power steered low loader
* Flats, complete with twist locks and stake sockets.

A load escort service is also provided along with all necessary authority notifications.
Our experienced personnel also carry out all necessary site inspections, route surveys and feasibility studies.

The acquisition of a 90T/m crane truck with a 30m reach has enhanced the service provided. This vehicle is complete with a drawbar trailer to further extend the transportation 
options.

Currently goods in transit insurance covers up to Â£500,000.00, all risks, in any one load.  This value may be increased as required.
If load requirements exceed 80T, we have well established links with other hauliers throughout the UK.
 
Risk assessment and method statements are prepared for lifts/transport as appropriate.
